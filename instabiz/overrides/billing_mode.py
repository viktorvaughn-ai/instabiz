"""instabiz.overrides.billing_mode

Central switch for the "billing isn't live yet" workaround used across
revenue/AR/AP reporting (Sales Target, AR/AP Aging, Business Pulse, Main
Dashboard, Analytics Hub, Finance Dashboard, Party Outstanding Summary).

Real Sales/Purchase Invoices barely exist in this instance yet, so every
one of those was individually hardcoded to read Sales Order / Purchase
Order instead — each with its own comment, each done at a different time,
some only partially (e.g. a dashboard's revenue figure switched but its
AR/outstanding figure quietly left pointing at Sales Invoice, still
reading zero). That drift is exactly the bug this module exists to stop:
one flag, checked everywhere, so flipping to real invoicing later is a
one-line config change instead of re-auditing 7 files again.

Toggle via site_config.json:
    "ib_billing_mode": "dev"   — read Sales Order / Purchase Order (default)
    "ib_billing_mode": "prod"  — read Sales Invoice / Purchase Invoice

Defaults to "dev" because that's the true current state: Delivery Note and
Sales Invoice aren't part of the live workflow yet, so a Sales Order's own
`status` never moves past "Pending" — it carries no billing signal at all.
Revenue/AR/AP must be read off Sales Order / Purchase Order or the numbers
are just wrong, not "conservatively zero".
