"""instabiz.overrides.customer_dormant_escalation

Daily scheduler: 3-tier escalation for an OWNED customer with no submitted
Sales Order in a while (2026-09-04, user-designed feature — inactivity basis,
reassign target, and no-override were all explicit user decisions, not
guessed). Same "days since last submitted SO" basis dormant.py/
classify_customer()/the Customer list's recency highlight already use.

  30-59 days  -> bell notification to the owning rep ("heads up")
  60-89 days  -> a second, more urgent bell notification ("second warning")
  90+  days   -> customer is REASSIGNED to the next member of the SAME
                 territory team, round-robin (not to the unowned pool, not a
                 manager queue — explicit user choice)

State is tracked on Customer.custom_dormant_tier ("" / "30" / "60" / "90") —
the highest tier already actioned for the CURRENT inactivity streak. It
resets to "" the moment the customer is active again (days < 30), so a
customer that goes dormant more than once over its lifetime escalates fresh
each time rather than being silently skipped forever after its first cycle.
No rep override/snooze exists (explicit user decision) — the day count is
the only input.

Round-robin state lives on Lead Sales Team.custom_last_rotation_user (the
last member a reassignment landed on for that team) — advanced past the
customer's own outgoing owner if the naive next-in-line would be them.
