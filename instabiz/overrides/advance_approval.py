"""instabiz.overrides.advance_approval

Gate: a Sales Order that has an advance payment collected while still Draft
(custom_advance_paid > 0, docstatus == 0) can't be submitted/confirmed until
the designated approver signs off. custom_advance_approval_status is set to
"Pending" automatically the first time an advance lands on a Draft SO (see
payment_entry.py._update_so_advance) and resolved here via set_advance_approval().

Orders where the advance is collected AFTER the SO is already submitted are
unaffected — the gate only applies pre-confirmation.
