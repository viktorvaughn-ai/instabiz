	on-account path, see _update_advance_for_so / advance_approval.py). A
	given PE only ever uses one path or the other — the on-account "Record
	Advance (Deposit)" button never fills the references child table (that's
	the whole reason it exists: PaymentEntry.validate_reference_documents()
	throws if references points at a non-submitted SO) — so summing both
	here is safe, not a double-count. Without this shared helper, whichever
	path's own on_submit/on_cancel handler ran most recently would overwrite
	custom_advance_paid with only its own half of the total and silently
	drop whatever the other path had already collected — the same
	inline-duplicate-math class of bug already fixed once in
	ib_analytics_hub.py's advance_collected KPI.

	FOR UPDATE on both queries: without it, two Payment Entries submitted
	against the same SO close together (two reps recording deposits, a
	double-click, etc.) race under MariaDB's default REPEATABLE READ — each
	runs this SUM on its own connection/transaction, and a plain (non-locking)
	SELECT can't see the other PE's row until that other transaction commits,
	which for a doc-event hook doesn't happen until the whole request ends
	(long after on_submit returns). Both would then independently compute a
	total that only includes their own amount, and whichever set_value() in
	_recompute_so_advance_locked() lands last "wins" — silently dropping the
	other PE's contribution, with nothing else ever re-summing it afterward to
	self-correct. FOR UPDATE forces a genuine locking read: InnoDB's gap/
	insert-intention locking on the WHERE-clause index means a concurrent
	transaction's still-uncommitted matching INSERT/UPDATE blocks this read
	until that transaction actually commits or rolls back — not just until its
	hook function returns — which is what actually closes the gap (same
	mechanism, same reasoning, as create_order_sheet()'s own FOR UPDATE fix in
	production.py). Deliberately not "fixed" by an early frappe.db.commit()
	inside the hook instead — that would break the atomicity of the rest of
	this Payment Entry's own submit/cancel request (any later step failing
	would no longer roll back the already-committed advance-total write).
