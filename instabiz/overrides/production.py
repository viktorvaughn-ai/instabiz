	being confusing, see item 119; this query survived, unwired, until now).
	On Hold is included deliberately: a stage supervisor's most important row
	is what's stuck at their own station, not just what's actively moving —
	the old Kanban-era query only ever showed Pending/In Progress.

	auto_create_all_stage_wos() pre-creates one IB Work Order per stage in an
	item's whole route up front (see item 84) — a 4-stage item that hasn't
	started yet already has 4 real WO rows, all sitting Pending. A naive
	"every Pending/In Progress/On Hold WO" query (the original shape of this
	function) therefore showed that one item at all 4 of its stages
	simultaneously, before it had actually reached any of them — confirmed
	live 2026-08-05. Fixed by grouping WOs per item (order_sheet_item, same
	key _update_order_sheet_item() uses, falling back to order_sheet+item_code
	for legacy WOs missing it) and keeping only that item's CURRENT stage: the
	first stage in STAGES order that's In Progress/On Hold, else the earliest
	Pending one — same "current_stage" rule already used elsewhere in this
	file (see get_production_plan()'s order_wise item loop).

	Returns everything for every stage in one call (counts double as each
	stage pill's badge) rather than a per-stage endpoint — this page's real
	WO volume doesn't justify N+1 fetches every time the picker changes tabs.

	range) and get_machine_wise_dashboard()'s "today" per-machine stats —
	one formula, not two copies that can drift.

	Grain: whatever the caller aggregated to (this app uses machine-per-day
	both places). Formulas, and why they're shaped this way given the real
	live data as of 2026-08-10 (verified via console before writing this):

	Availability = run_hours (real SUM(completed_at - started_at) across
	  Completed WOs in the window — the same field get_dpr()/
	  get_weekly_dpr() already trust) / available_hours, capped at 100%.
	  NOTE: in the live dataset, WOs are completed 0-67s after being started
	  (avg 5.8s across all 30 Completed WOs, verified live) because
	  production is still in a testing phase (CLAUDE.md item 96) — floor
	  users aren't yet leaving WOs "In Progress" for real durations. This
	  formula is correct and will self-correct automatically as real usage
	  matures; today it reads low for every machine, which honestly reflects
	  the current data-capture-maturity gap rather than a bug here (same
	  class of gap already flagged for wastage_pct in this file, see below).

	Performance = ideal hours to produce output_qty at the machine's rated
	  capacity, divided by run_hours, capped at 100% (standard OEE
	  convention — exceeding 100% just means the rate assumption/capacity
	  master is off, not that the machine outran physics; given run_hours is
	  currently tiny per the note above, the raw ratio is often far above
	  100% before capping). None when capacity/capacity_uom is unset on the
	  Machine (many real machines have this blank) or run_hours is 0.

	Quality = 1 - avg_wastage_pct/100. IB Work Order.wastage_qty/wastage_pct
	  are hardcoded 0.0 at WO creation and never written by any real
	  completion path system-wide (confirmed via grep + live query: 0/30
	  Completed WOs have nonzero wastage) — the exact gap get_dpr() already
	  documents and deliberately omits wastage for. Reported as None
	  ("no data") rather than a false 100%/perfect-quality reading, matching
	  that precedent, until a real wastage-capture flow exists. Known
	  limitation: a genuinely zero-wastage day would also read as "no data"
	  under this heuristic (there's no separate "measured" flag on the WO to
	  disambiguate) — acceptable today since no capture path ever writes a

	already applied to get_so_production_status/get_order_sheet_detail (see
	their comments). This function was missed during that pass: an Order Sheet
	with two lines sharing one item_code (a real, valid scenario) had both
	lines' Work Orders merged into a single stage set here, so the Production
	Tracker's pct/current_stage and the 25/50/75/100% milestone notifications
	(on_work_order_update_notify, which calls this) could both be wrong for
	such an order even though the drill-down timeline (get_so_production_status)
	already showed the correct per-item split.
